      "The purpose of this project proposal is to present “Rehnuma”, an intelligent animated\n",
      "tutoring system designed to assist students in understanding advanced statistical concepts\n",
      "with greater clarity and efficiency. In the current educational environment, students of-\n",
      "ten face significant challenges when dealing with probability and statistics, particularly\n",
      "during their initial semesters where prior exposure is limited. Traditional learning re-\n",
      "sources such as static notes, lengthy textbooks, or unstructured online videos often fail to\n",
      "provide personalized and interactive explanations. Rehnuma bridges this gap by offering\n",
      "a system that dynamically generates animated videos, coupled with explanatory narra-\n",
      "tion, tailored to specific queries raised by students. By integrating large language models\n",
      "(LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and Manim animations, the\n",
